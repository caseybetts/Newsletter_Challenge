# Newsletter_Challenge

## My First Webpage
This is a standalone webpage created for the purpose of learning HTML, CSS and Java Script. 

## Credits
This webpage is based on the 'News homepage' challenge from the Frontend Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).
The graphics and the layout were provided by the challege creators. I also followed the basic steps of this Coder Coder youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_kHIAkucA&t=1702s
Coder Coder was using a different Frontend Mentor challenge as an example, but there were enough differences between my challenge and her challenge so that understanding of the code was necessary.
